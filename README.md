# Parking-System
The **Parking System** is a Java-based application designed using **OOP principles**, featuring a **Swing GUI** for an interactive interface and a **local database** for secure data storage. It provides separate functionalities for **admins** and **clients**, ensuring efficient parking management. Clients can **register, log in, and manage their vehicles**, while admins oversee **parking slots, monitor vehicle entries/exits, and handle user registrations**. The system supports multiple vehicle types using **polymorphism** and keeps track of available and occupied slots in real time.
